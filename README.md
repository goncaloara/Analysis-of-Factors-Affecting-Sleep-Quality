Given the critical role of sleep in health maintenance and disease prevention, this project aims to examine the relative contributions of stress levels, sleep disorders, physical activity, and gender on sleep quality through non-parametric statistical analysis. This approach allows for a robust examination of these relationships without assuming normal distribution of the data, thereby providing more reliable insights into these complex interactions. By computing tests including the Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Spearman correlation test, this analysis aims to infer whether these variables have significant effects on sleep quality  and to what extent they contribute to variations in sleep outcomes.
